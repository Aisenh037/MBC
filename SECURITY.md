## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the MBC Department Management System seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**DO NOT** open a public issue on GitHub. Global security practices dictate that vulnerabilities should be reported privately to the maintainers first, allowing time for a fix to be developed before disclosure.

### How to Report

Please email us at `aisenh037@gmail.com` with the following details:

1.  **Type of Vulnerability**: (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, RCE, etc.)
2.  **Full Description**: Detailed explanation of the vulnerability.
3.  **Reproduction Steps**: Clear steps to reproduce the issue.
4.  **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the exploitation.

### What to Expect

1.  **Response**: You will receive a response within 48 hours acknowledging receipt of your report.
2.  **Assessment**: We will investigate the issue and verify its severity.
3.  **Fix**: If confirmed, we will work on a patch.
4.  **Disclosure**: Once fixed, we will credit you (if desired) in our release notes and Security Advisories.

Thank you for helping keep our system safe!
